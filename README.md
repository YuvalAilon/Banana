# Banana | CY2550 TA Project
The purpose of this project is to showcase how programs can be unexpectedly
hidden within other programs. Each of the programs in this repository
hide the base "banana" program, which downloads a photo of a banana from the web
onto the user's computer. This benign program is a stand-in for a  malicious one.

This project is intended for educational purposes and <u>cannot cause any harm to your machine</u>.
The "malicious" program was intentionally designed to be harmless, so code could be investigated
and run without any ill effects.

Below is a list of how each file hides the banana program. This list will be updated as more
programs are developed:

## Banana
This is the "malicious" program that will be hidden in the rest of the projects.
